# Tic-Tac-Toe

Here are the basic rules of tic-tac-toe:

1. The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid.

2. Player goes first to choose X or O.

3. Player 1 goes first and marks one of the empty squares with the chosen X or O.

4. Then, player 2 takes their turn and marks one of the remaining empty squares with an "O."

5. Players continue taking turns, marking empty squares with their respective symbols, until one of the following conditions is met:
   - A player has three of their symbols (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
   - All nine squares are filled without any player achieving three in a row. In this case, the game is a tie.

6. If a player successfully forms a line of three of their symbols, they win the game. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game is a tie.
